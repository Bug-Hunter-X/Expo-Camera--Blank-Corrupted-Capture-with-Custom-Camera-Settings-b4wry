This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  The issue manifests as an inability to properly capture images or videos, frequently resulting in blank or corrupted files. This is often observed when setting specific camera parameters, such as flash mode or focus mode, that are not fully supported by the underlying device's camera hardware or Expo's implementation.  The exact error messages may vary, but often involve missing data or exceptions during file processing.
